  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This is an example of a very simple web applications using only the tools that SBT (simple build tool) and it's echo-system offers. No need of bower, npm, or grunt. Web dependencies management is handled by the sbt-web plugin by means of webjars.</p>

  <h3>Known Bugs</h3>
  <p>If the client receives a message saying that the resource cant not be found, close the activator ui and try to run this application using the activator interactive shell. But before that, remove the file "&lt;project-base&gt;/project/sbt-ui.sbt" or comment its content. Said file is added by activator during the template instantiation to activate the sbt-core-next plugin required by the activator ui. Unfortunately this plugin causes the classpath be incomplete at runtime, impeding the application to obtain the resources it needs.I have already reported <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-core-next/issues/9">said bug</a> in the sbt-core-next plugin site.</p>
