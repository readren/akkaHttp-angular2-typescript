		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This is an example of a very simple web applications using only
			the tools that SBT (simple build tool) and it's echo-system offers.
			No need of bower, npm, or grunt. Web dependencies management is
			handled by the sbt-web plugin by means of webjars.</p>
		<p>

				href="https://github.com/readren/akkaHttp-angular2-typescript">project
				site</a>.

		<h3>How to run</h3>
		<p>
			Press the "run" button located at the top of the "run pane" of the <b>activator
				ui</b>, and go to <a href="http://localhost:9000">http://localhost:9000</a>
			using another browser tab.
		</p>
		<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
		<p>
			If the client receives a message saying that the resource can not be
			found, close the <b>activator ui</b> and try to run this application
			using the activator interactive shell. But before that, remove the
			file <i>&lt;project-base&gt;/project/sbt-ui.sbt</i> or comment its
			content. Said file is added by activator during the template
			instantiation to activate the <b>sbt-core-next</b> plugin required by
			the <b>activator ui</b>. Unfortunately this plugin causes the
			classpath be incomplete at runtime, impeding the application to
			obtain the resources it needs.I have already reported <a
				href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-core-next/issues/9">said bug</a> in
			the sbt-core-next plugin site.
