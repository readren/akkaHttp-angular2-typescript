#Akka-Http Angular2 Typescript sample application 

This branch is identical to the master, except that the angular application in the client side was replaced with the [angluar2 "tour of heros" tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/).
Unlike the "TODO MVC" in the 'master' branch, and the "quick start" in the 'quickStart' branch, this app interacts with the server because the heroes table is mantained in the server side.
